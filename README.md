# Transiting-Brown-Dwarfs
Data analysis plots and tabulated data of transiting brown dwarfs and very low mass stars

This repository can create the tables and plots from Grieves et al. 2021, Populating the brown dwarf and stellar boundary: Five stars with transiting companions near the hydrogen-burning mass limit, A&A, 652, A12
